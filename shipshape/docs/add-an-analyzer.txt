Deploy an analyzer using Shipshape
==================================
Ciera Jaspan <ciera@google.com>
v0.1.0, 5-Oct-2015

== Dependencies

Let's first make sure you're set up with the necessary tools to build and deploy a shipshape analyzer. You will need:

  * Docker
  * The Shipshape API (currently supporting go and Java)
  * The Shipshape CLI
  * Whatever language tools and dependencies your analyzer needs to build and run

The Linux instructions work for Ubuntu 10.14+. Alternately, you can create a GCE instance from our provided setup image, which has everything you need pre-installed. We do not support Mac/Windows at this time, due to a bug in Docker.

For this tutorial, we be creating an analyzer implemented in Go.

=== GCE
Make a Google Compute Engine project
Create an instance using the shipshape image
ssh into your instance

=== Linux
sudo apt-get install docker-engine
wget go stufff here
Get shipshape's go library
go get github.com/google/shipshape/shipshape/api
TODO: provide the java instructions
wget the shipshape CLI, put it in /usr/bin



== Implement your analyzer

=== Go
* Implement api.Analyzer. As an example, check out
  https://github.com/google/shipshape/blob/master/shipshape/androidlint_analyzer/androidlint/analyzer.go
* Implement a server that serves on port 10005 and uses api.AnalyzerService.
  Example:
  https://github.com/google/shipshape/blob/master/shipshape/androidlint_analyzer/androidlint/service.go

=== Java
TODO

== Create a Docker file
* Create a docker file that
    * Adds all dependencies needed to run your analyzer
    * Adds your analyzer
    * Has port 10005 open
    * Starts your service
    https://github.com/google/shipshape/blob/master/shipshape/androidlint_analyzer/docker/DockerFile
* Create an enpoint script that starts the service
https://github.com/google/shipshape/blob/master/shipshape/androidlint_analyzer/docker/endpoint.sh

== Test your analyzer locally

Build a docker image with the tag "local"
docker build myanalyzer/DockerFile --name=sflwslfms --tag=local

Run the local analyzer
shipshape --analyzer_image=sdkfjslkfjds --categories=lk;fkdslk
directory

== Push it up to gcr.io or docker.io
docker tag
docker push sldfjslfjslkdfsldkfm

== Test your public analyzer
shipshape --analyzer_image=sdkfjslkfjds --categories=lk;fkdslk

Add it to our list!
