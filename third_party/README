To add a new component to this third_party directory, follow these steps:

1) Have a discussion on shipshape-users@googlegroups.com;
2) Provide a clear rational in the change adding the third_party code;
3) Add the third_party code in a patch containing no other changes;
4) Add a third_party/<projectxyz>/README.google file describing the
   origin of the code, its licensing, and any local changes;
5) Have the change reviewed by multiple people in the team;
6) Check with collinwinter@google.com on licensing.

Thank you.
